# finder

## Goals and functionalities

Finder's goal is essentially to "mimic" an infamous dating app. This was our first introduction to Provider pattern. It has a main page which is essentially a list of tiles that you can click on. Clicking a tile redirects you to a Details page from where you can like a "Bachelor" whom you can retrieve in a "Liked" list upon clicking a button on the main page. You can also "dislike" a Bachelor, which makes him disappear from the list.
